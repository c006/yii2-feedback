Yii2 Feedback
===================



Installation
------------

The preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

`
php composer.phar require --prefer-source "c006/yii2-feedback" "*"
`

or add

`
"c006/yii2-feedback": "dev-master"
`

to the require section of your `composer.json` file.


Run
-----

Migrations `m000000_000000_c006_feedback`

I would suggest using my console, it's very easy to update migrations.


Usage
-----

Place were you like. 

`<span id="feedback">feedback</span>`


Place at bottom of page

`<?= \c006\feedback\WidgetFeedback::widget([]); ?>`
